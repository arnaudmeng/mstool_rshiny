## **Requirements**

To be able to perform mass predictions, mass list should have been upload in the ***Load mass list*** menu.

## **Button functions**

### **Load file** box

<span style="color:red">**Not impemented. Ignore this box**</span>.

### **Load file** box

<span style="color:red">**Not impemented. Ignore this box**</span>.

### **Prediction parameters** box

Use the **Select atoms** button to check one or multiple atoms to use for the prediction. 
Available atoms and their respective mass correspond to the mass list uploaded in the ***Load mass list*** menu.

The text box **Enter a mass** allow the user to write a mass to be used for the formula prediction.

Adjust the mass tolerance to consider for the formula prediction using the **Enter a tolerance** button.

<span style="color:red">Be careful, a larger mass tolerance result in a longer computation time. Consider using a small mass tolerance for your prediction</span>.

### **Prediction results** box

Resulting predictions are displayed in this table. 

The element/atom column allow the user to filter the formula based on the number of atom to in the resulting predictions : use the two-sided sliders to restrict the 
number of atoms to a thinner window of atom number.

<span style="color:blue"> **mass_delta** corresponds to the mass difference between the predicted formula and the input mass used for prediction</span>. 

Use the **show** menu to inscrease the number of lines displayed in the view. 

You can copy to clipboard or save the table using the **Copy**, **CSV**, **Excel** or **PDF** buttons.
