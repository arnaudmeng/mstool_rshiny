## **Requirements**

To be able to compute a formula mass, mass list should have been upload in the ***Load mass list*** menu.

If you want to obtain the adduct mass of your compound, please define your modifier(s) in the ***Define modifier*** menu.

## **Button functions**

### **User formula** box

Write a formula in the **Enter your formula** text box. 

The formula can use *semi-developped formula* or *empirical formula*.

Click the **Submit** button to run the mass calculation.

### **Compound information** box

Three information are displayed :

- The total mass of your compound 
- The number of different atoms in your compound
- The total number of atom in your compound

### **Formula detail table** box

This table shows the sub-details of the masses in your compound per atom. 

<span style="color:blue"> **Mass_sum** corresponds to the total mass of each different atom considering the number of atom</span>. 

Use the **show** menu to inscrease the number of lines displayed in the view. 

You can copy to clipboard or save the table using the **Copy**, **CSV**, **Excel** or **PDF** buttons.

### **Adduct summary** box

The resulting adduct masses are displayed in this table if modifier(s) have been previously defined in the ***Define modifier*** menu.

<span style="color:blue"> **RelMass** corresponds to the relative mass that has been applied to the compound mass to compute the adduct mass</span>. 

<span style="color:blue"> **AdductMass** corresponds to the total mass of the resulting adduct mass</span>. 

<span style="color:red">Note that the resulting adduct mass takes into account the electron removal/addition based on the charge for each adduct</span>.

Use the **show** menu to inscrease the number of lines displayed in the view. 

You can copy to clipboard or save the table using the **Copy**, **CSV**, **Excel** or **PDF** buttons.
